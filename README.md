The instagram clone project is made by using react and tailwind css. it comprises of three pages 1) the login page 2) the Home page 3) the Profile page. i have used react's routes component to route to the different pages. i have made components like the timeline post feed, the story of dummy users, the sideline bar, the suggestions bar in the home page. the profile opttion in the home page routes to the profile page. the posts offers viewing of the images in a sildeshow manner. On clicking next button it moves to newer posts and on clicking previous button it moves to older posts. Also vertical scrolling is also available in the timeline area of home page. in the profile pages it shows the number of posts made by the user and the followers and following count. it shows the user's posts in a slideshow manner.
